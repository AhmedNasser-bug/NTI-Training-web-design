# NTI-Training-web-design
Tracking the tasks and content of the National Telecommunication institute's summer web design training
This repo is made to track my progress in the NTI Web design summer training program, along side submitting assigned tasks.


## Week 1:
- Day 1:
        I'm excited to finish this training even more now that the content of the very first session is dense, I came up with an analogy of a tree structure of the html file (perhaps this is the DOM tree) with each node of the tree being html tags, tags also acting as the data type of the note, explaining what does this node contribute to the full tree (the full file) 
- Day 2:
        Happy to finish html basics, and really excited to style it with css and apply logic and dynamicity to the html static boring tags
